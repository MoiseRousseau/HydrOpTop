About topology optimization
===========================

Optimization problems
---------------------

A general description of an optimization problem. Method to solve: try and
error, gradient descent, derivative-free, blackbox


Design optimization
-------------------

Design optimization can be considered as a sub-class of optimization problem which the objective is to find the geometrical characteristic of a system which is optimal relatively to a certain objective.
For example, 

There are three general approach to design optimization, namely the parametric, the shape, and the topology approach. The last is the one HydrOpTop uses.

Different approach for topology optimization
--------------------------------------------

Discrete approach
'''''''''''''''''

The implicit field can take discrete value.
Typically, the implicit field takes 0-1 value, where 0 represent one material and 1 the other.
Extention to more than 2 materials is possible (e.g. ).
However, optimization problem using discrete variable is mathematically complicated.
Often solved using heuristic algorithm.

Level-set approach
''''''''''''''''''

Material interface and boundary are encoded by the surface where p(x,y)=a.
No more mesh dependent.
Can use information from 


Density approach
''''''''''''''''
