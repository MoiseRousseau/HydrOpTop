Installation
============

HydrOpTop could be installed using Python3 ``pip3`` command:

``pip3 install HydrOpTop``

Shields with the supported solvers are already included, but solvers must be installed or compiled separately (see :doc:`../user_guide/solvers.rst` section in user guide).

Note, this library is in its first versions, so syntax may change fast and without notice. Once a certain stability will be reach, a first stable version will be released.
