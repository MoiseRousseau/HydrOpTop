Topology optimization  
One may think of what would be the shape of a mechanical part such as its mechanical compliance is being minimized while a volume constraint is applied. 
Or, another wants to maximize the draining capacity of a soil by smarter drain placement.
Another again would like to dissipate as efficiently as possible heat by an optimized heat exchanger.
HydrOpTop permits to solve all of these problems and in these various disciplines by using a unified software.

Topology optimization with density based approach.

General purpose library that allow you to interface your own solver to solve your problem, solver free.

Develop and compare several approach, solver, material parametrization

Up to date, two solvers are interfaced


What HydrOpTop can do ?
-----------------------

Distribute one or several material in a domain such as an objective is reached.

Handle any solver through dedicaced input/output shell solver specific (but which need to be written)

Handle any objective function, filters or constraints predefined or written by the user.

Allow user to define well written tpology optimization problem in few lines

Write results in open format which allow creating great graphics

Solve topology optimization problem constrained by one PDE as well as various coupled PDE, time dependent problem

By extension, any large scale inverse problem can be solved (geophysics, calibration, ...)


What HydrOpTop cannot do ?
--------------------------

It is not a miraculous software which you design your solution for you.
