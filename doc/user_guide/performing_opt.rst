Basic optimization
==================

See the Getting started.


Imposing length constrain
=========================

Topology optimization using SIMP method could be create small structure 
impossible to manufacture or to build on the field.

A mix a the standard density filter and of the Heavyside function could be
use as a length constrain control.
