Performing Optimization
=======================

Problem Setup
-------------

A HydrOpTop optimization problem must contains:
A cost function to minimize
A PFLOTRAN simulation that will return the cost function inputs
A optimization domain parametrization (via the material)
Constrains

Then, all these classes are passed to the problem crafter so that the
internal machinery of HydrOpTop is set.


The Crafter Class
-----------------
