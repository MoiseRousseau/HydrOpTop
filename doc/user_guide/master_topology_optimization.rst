Master Topology Optimization with HydrOpTop
===========================================

Current challenge associated with topology optimization
-------------------------------------------------------

Imposing length constraint
--------------------------

Topology optimization using SIMP method could be create small structure 
impossible to manufacture or to build on the field.

A mix a the standard density filter and of the Heavyside function could be
use as a length constrain control.


Additive manufacturing
----------------------


Topology optimization under uncertainty
---------------------------------------


Export to CAD format
--------------------

Level set remesh to create a triangulated surface and write in STL
