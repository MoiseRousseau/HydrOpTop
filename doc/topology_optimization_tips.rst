Imposing length constraint
--------------------------

Topology optimization using SIMP method could be create small structure 
impossible to manufacture or to build on the field.

A mix a the standard density filter and of the Heavyside function could be
use as a length constrain control.


Additive manufacturing

Topology optimization under uncertainty

Export to CAD format
