Overview
========

HydrOpTop aimed at provide tools to perform topology optimization for 
geoenvironmental engineering.  It adresses the general problem of finding the
optimal design of a system to maximize its performances and submitted to some
constrains. One may think of where to place a reactive barrier near a 
contamined site to maximize the recuperation of a contaminant. Or, another
wants to maximize the draining capacity of a soil by smarter drain placement.
HydrOpTop permitted to solve both of these problems using topology 
optimization. 

HydrOpTop consists of several Python classes, already-made objectives, 
constrains, material parametrizations that allow the user to perform 
topology optimization effortlessly. It is build upon popular Python packages
such as numpy and scipy to run topology optimization, while the hydrogeological
solver uses the finite volume flow and transport code PFLOTRAN (see X).
