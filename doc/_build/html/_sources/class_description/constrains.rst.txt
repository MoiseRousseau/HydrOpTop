Constrain classes
=================

Constrain
---------

The constrain class implements the optimization constrains (equality or 
inequality) of the topology optimization problem. 

Available constrains
--------------------

*   `Maximum_Volume(cell_ids_to_consider, max_volume)`: Constrain 
    the material defined by `p=1` to occupy at most `max_volume*100` % of the considered domain).
    `cell_ids_to_consider` is a list of cell ids on which to constrain the maximum
    volume and `max_volume` the maximum volume fraction allowed on the given cell
    ids.


Implement yours
---------------

You can create your own constrains and pass it directly to the optimizer of 
your choice. However, if you want to use it in the `Crafter` class, each new 
constrain class are required to have several methods in HydrOpTop. They are:

*   `__need_p_cell_ids__(self)` which should return `True` if the correspondance 
    between `p` and the PFLOTRAN cell ids is needed, `False` in the opposite case.

*   `__get_PFLOTRAN_output_variable_needed__(self)` which return a list of the
    PFLOTRAN output variables needed for your new class operation. Variable should
    be orthographied as in OUTPUT card.

*   `set_inputs(self, inputs)`

*   `set_p_cell_ids(self, cell_ids)`

*   `set_filter(self, filter)`

\
The following method is required by the `nlopt` library:

*   `evaluate(self, p, grad)` where `p` and `grad` are the argument passed by 
    `nlopt` optimizer. `p` is the material density parameter in the region to 
    optimize and `grad` the gradient of the constrain w.r.t. `p`. This function 
    should return the constrain value and the its derivative w.r.t. the density
    parameter `p`.
