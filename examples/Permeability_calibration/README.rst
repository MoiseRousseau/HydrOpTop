Permeability calibration with PFLOTRAN
======================================

HydrOpTop can be used to calibrate permeability field in PFLOTRAN simulation. 
Below is different examples showing how to acheived that, from a simple 2D permeability field calibration to a complex 3D model with multiple hydrostratigraphic units.
