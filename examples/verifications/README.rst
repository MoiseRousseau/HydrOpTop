Verification examples (not hydrogeology)
========================================

* **Cantilever_simple**: The classical TO benchmark using a homemade 2D linear elasticity FEM solver. Consists in minimizing the mechanical compliance of a cantilever under a maximum volume constraint.
* **Cantilever_discrete**: The same previous classical benchmark but using a Heaviside projection to create a discrete final design.
* **Cantilever_min_volume**: A variation of the classical benchmark consisting in minimizing the weight (i.e. the volume) of the cantilever under a maximum mechanical compliance constraint.
