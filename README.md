# HydrOpTop

HydrOpTop is a Python library that permits solving hydrogeology optimization problem using the adjoint method, primarly using the PFLOTRAN groundwater and reactive transport code.


## Getting started

HydrOpTop library can be easily installed using Python ``pip`` command as:

```
pip install HydrOpTop
```

Installation includes all the different HydrOpTop modules (material parametrization, functions, filters) including the solver I/O shields (see [here](https://hydroptop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/solvers.html) for the list of interfaced solvers).
However, users need to install solvers manually.
Solver installation instructions for HydrOpTop can be found in the documentation [here](https://hydroptop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).

[Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) software is also recommanded to visualize HydrOpTop results.



## Examples

See the Example section of the [documentation](https://hydroptop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which contains numerous problem to illustrate what HydrOpTop is capable of.
Source files of the example are under the ``examples`` folder.
